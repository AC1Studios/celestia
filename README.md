A Discord Bot with focus on Fun, Moderation, Economy, Utility commands and much more.

YOU ARE FREE TO USE ITS CODE AS REFERENCE FOR YOUR OWN BOTS. 

**Note: I am not testing every single command, I would really appreciate it that if you would find any errors that may occurr, to open an issue and I'll fix them as fast as I can!**

## Filling out the .env file

*Note: Remove the .example part from both the .env and config.js files, once you are done!*

### Bot-related Information:
* `CELESTIA_TOKEN=` is the bot's token. You can get it from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
* `CELESTIA_PREFIX=` is the default prefix of the bot. Can be changed to anything you want. Default is c.
* `CELESTIA_ID=` is the ID of your bot. This is so far only used for the `rate` command (yet).

### System:
* `ADMIN=` Bot Admin User ID. Not required, and totally optional.
* `SUPPORT=` Bot Support User ID. Not required, and totally optional.
* `SYSTEM_NOTICE=` Leave this to `true`, which is set by default. This shouldn't be touched.

### Emoji IDs:
`GEM_EMOJI_ID=` is used by the Economy commands. As example, Celestia uses Gems as currency system, aka a custom Gem emoji to actually display the currency. This is totally optional!

### Roles:
*Note:  Feel free to change these roles for your server. It's not required to change them though. Defaults below. Those are for the permission level function, so that the bot knows who is an Admin, Moderator, or user.*
* `MOD_ROLE=` Moderator role on a server. Default is `Moderator`.
* `ADMIN_ROLE=` Admin role on a server. Default is `Administrator`.

### API KEYS, Secrets, and more:

### Feedback Command
*Note: This is a Channel ID for the channel you want to view feedback from. It's not really required, so delete it, with the feedback command, if you don't want or need it.*
`FEEDBACK_CHANNEL=` is simply the channel ID of any channel in the main server the bot should be in.
