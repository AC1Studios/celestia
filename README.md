Celestia 2.3.3 Â©2018-2020 Azura Apple#0955

A Discord Bot with focus on Fun, Moderation, Economy, Utility commands and much more.

YOU ARE FREE TO USE ITS CODE AS REFERENCE FOR YOUR OWN BOTS. 

**Note: I am not testing every single command, I would really appreciate it that if you would find any errors that may occurr, to open an issue and I'll fix them as fast as I can!**

## Filling out the .env file

*Note: Remove the .example part from both the .env and config.js files, once you are done!*

### Bot-related Information:
* `CELESTIA_TOKEN=` is the bot's token. You can get it from [here](https://discord.com/developers/applications/).
* `CELESTIA_PREFIX=` is the default prefix of the bot. Can be changed to anything you want. Default is c.
* `CELESTIA_ID=` is the ID of your bot. This is so far only used for the `rate` command (yet).

### System:
* `ADMIN=` Bot Admin User ID. Not required, and totally optional.
* `SUPPORT=` Bot Support User ID. Not required, and totally optional.
* `SYSTEM_NOTICE=` Leave this to `true`, which is set by default. This shouldn't be touched.

### Emoji IDs (All of them are totally optional!):
* `BAN_EMOJI_ID=` is used by the Moderation commands `ban` and `forceban`.
* `FEEDBACK_EMOJI_ID=` is used by the Core command `feedback`.
* `GEM_EMOJI_ID=` is used by the Economy commands. As example, Celestia uses Gems as currency system, aka a custom Gem emoji to actually display the currency.
* `KICK_EMOJI_ID=` is used by the Moderation command `kick`.
* `REPORT_EMOJI_ID=` is used by the Moderation command `report`. 
* `WARN_EMOJI_ID=` is used by the Moderation command `warn`.

### Roles:
*Note:  Feel free to change these roles for your server. It's not required to change them though. Defaults below. Those are for the permission level function, so that the bot knows who is an Admin, Moderator, or user.*
* `MOD_ROLE=` Moderator role on a server. Default is `Moderator`.
* `ADMIN_ROLE=` Admin role on a server. Default is `Administrator`.

* `CLEARBIT_KEY=` can be obtained at the [Clearbit dashboard](https://dashboard.clearbit.com/login).
* `GOOGLE_API=` can be obtained by going to the Google API. You need to create a new Application on the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/home/dashboard). After that, enable the [YouTube Data API](https://console.cloud.google.com/marketplace/product/google/youtube.googleapis.com?q=youtube&id=125bab65-cfb6-4f25-9826-4dcc309bc508&project=azura-278914&hl).

### Feedback Command
*Note: This is a Channel ID for the channel you want to view feedback from. It's not really required, so delete it, with the feedback command, if you don't want or need it.*
`FEEDBACK_CHANNEL=` is simply the channel ID of any channel in the main server the bot should be in.

### Imgur Album IDS
As all of these keys are the same process, this is a little different. You need to first sign up for Imgur. Then you just need to go to your profile and make albums that contain the images for the command(s) you want to use. Use the ID of that album (look at the URL) as the variable. Yes, you need to fill these albums yourself.
